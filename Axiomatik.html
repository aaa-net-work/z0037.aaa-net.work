          Its dark, you are robot
          with low battery level - seeking for a charging station that can be usually found at the next exit elevator. The only help you have is a kind
          of shooting device that shoots bouncing balls which can illuminate the environment architecture. You might encounter philosphical thought experiments, like Schroedingser cat box
          or quantum states teleporter on your way ... <br> <br>

    <div class = "text2wide"> <p> AXIOMATIK  Work in Progress ... <br><br>
      We started prototyping Axiomatik in summer 2024. The basic idea was to create a minimalistic VR exit/ platform game that focuses on the game play haptics.
      Axioms, as a definition or first thesis in geometry (or mathematics or physics), will define one after another rules for the gameplay, changing the 
      game, the games look or gameplay functionality over the long run. 
      Our vision in style was an early computer games look and sound, where we wanted the player to modify the game environment with a shooting mechanic
      that is similar to drawing or revealing by drawing the obstacles. The level design should be black and neon - light illuminated line structures, 
      abstract, brutalisc or just basic shape formed but remain as a riddle to the player. <br>

      <br><br>A lot of ideas are inspired by concepts of classical physics and quantum mechanics - 
      and so we thought: why not have these ideas and concepts as our backstory?
      <br>Have you ever seen Schrödingers Box in "real"? Have you fully understood it? Did you ever wanted to understand it?
      Did you ever played the Maxwellsche Demon ? Selecting cold and warm particles from each other to raise the pressure and temperature? <br> no ?!<br> Well... then its probably time to play this game!

      in the background the game will do the actual quantum mechanical calculation of a wave function collapse in order to decide if the cat is dead or alive. Dead kittens will have a different behavior as alive ones. Alive kitten behavior are already in our prototype
      using Unreals behavior tree tool for AI-programming. Cats are your friends ! they are most likely attracted by catfood which can be provided by the player but cats ! have their own will, they run after balls 
      do not follow the rules...

  <div class = "text2wide"> <p> Axiom 1: <br> <br> Reflection on surface - linear approximation of a bouncing ball trajectory. Ball is reflected and bounces of blocking environment, many trajectories will reveal the negative space by 
    drawing lines in the gaps between obstacles. This effect is working very good in VR - and is much more difficult to play on screen in 3D.

  <div class = "text2wide"> <p> Axiom 2: <br> <br> Consider yourself in young´s double slit experiment, where either wave or particle goes through a double slit. Wether you are a particle or a wave the pathway after the slits is different.
    Our Quantum Portals adapt this idea in a similar way: the player decides to go through either right or left portal, the game decides if the player is treated as particle or wave - and as a result the player ends up in a different destination.
    No worry, players still might figure out how this teleportation algorithm works!

  <div class = "text2wide"> <p> Axiomatik goes APK on meta Quest - first approach of optimization was part of our sprint in December 2024.
    Because of our drawing mechanic added up drawcalls, the more the player was shooting, our apk was barely running on Quest2. We optimized
    the game a lot with e.g. pooling methods for the bullet actors, reducing the mesh complexity, checked a ton of render parameters and even went back 
    to older methods like using sprites. And viola: without some further frame interpolation of a meta plugin, we are almost stable with 72fps on APK running on Quest2 :D.
    <br> Sure there is still a lot (*....*) to do, but our milestone: to evaluate if this drawing idea would be doable for us on APK is achieved, and the answer is: YES!
