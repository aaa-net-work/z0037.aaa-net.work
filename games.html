      <div class = "subtext">
        <p> Coming from experimental media art and having a walkaround in relativistic physics, i got interested in game programming in 2017. What first was a
        hobby using Unity, i professionalised from 2020 on with learning and using UnrealEngine (now 4.25-5.4). In game development i find both (plenty) of my interests in art / creativity and 
        phyics/ science combined: a field that brings it all together. I am specialised on VR-applications and art game production, with an expertise next to all 
        that tech stuff, in novel narrative structures, audio and development of intuitive user ineractions (which is a thing in VR ...).

      Directors: Stan Liguzinski,<a href=https://www.ibrahimquraishi.net>  Ibrahim Quraishi</a>), is a unconventional dating encounter in VR. Multiplayer via Steam API for 2 persons, a get-to-know-each-other in a playful & arty environment. 
      In this project i was the leading gameplay programmer and at some point i became a part of the conception, as various scene and gameplay ideas by me where added. Roamance is supposed to have its premiere
      at art festivals in 2024, a work in progress is shown at <a href=https://2024.amaze-berlin.de/ > Amaze Berlin 2024</a> .

  <div class = "text2wide"> <p> Parts of the full game of Roamance will be presented on Amaze2024 Berlin. It shows the on board room, the walking scene for both players to walk in the line of voice-chat senisitive particle efx 
    streetlights to have space for communication. Followed by the Dating-Game-Show where both players have to answer silly questions to evaluate if they are a match or not. The excerpt 
    closes with the separation scene - where a huge light ball swallows both players and separates them. In the full game version the multiplayer session is terminated after this scene with a transfer to a local scene map.

  <div class = flex-container> 
  <div class="poster-box"><img  class="poster-box" src="pictures/games/DicsoStill.png"  alt="Poster"></div>
  <div class = "text2wide"> <p> I worked with various beat-detection methods in Unreal4.27 - like Synesthesia Plugin and others to trigger and shape movements of interactive objects in time. 
    The difficulty i found is, that audio-frequency-by-amplitude discrimination works nicely but leaves us without a release (hold) function, as well needs a further normalization of all frequencies to 
    allow detection for dynamical changes in loudness of the music. Then, the movement triggered by beat detection basis on parametrized changes in direction, color, size, velocity and rotation within a tick-like function.
    The interactive objects in their interactivity (grabbable, destroyable) and in their movement where developed for ROAMANCE project to replicate for multiplayer.

      Until here it is just a "spline drawing on meshes" and 
      "using mathematical functions for instanced objects in 3D" working example. This test involved
      how much nausea a missing floor for VR players is causing.

. The used 3D Models originated from 
      real estate concepts and viewing these buildings inside and outside in VR enabled a close to reality impression for these projects. Light settings, weather change and  
      environmental surroundings tried to come close as possible to reality. Performance optimization and intuitive interaction (in detail: multiple functionality on one controller button, do not use to many buttons!) was the challenge to solve in this project. The video shows an in VR gameplay
      in our showroom project.
