        <p> Coming from experimental media art and having a solid background in relativistic physics (PhD), I got interested in game programming in 2017. What first began as a
        hobby using Unity, turned into a job from 2021 on with using UnrealEngine (now 4.25). In game development I find most of my interests and talents, art / creativity and 
        physics/ science combined: a field that brings it all together. I am spezialised on VR-applications and art game development, with an expertise in gameplay programming, multiplayer development,
        sound design and game conception.

    <br><br> (Game Conception, Production: UnrealEstate GmbH 2024, 
    Conception and Art Direction: me and Jacob Brosda), is violence free flight simulator adventure, where the player plays a bumble bee flying from one blossom to another, 
    collecting honey and pollen for food to fly and to store in the bumble bee home. The game is a flight simulator in the scale of a bumble bee flying in an ocean of giant plants and flowers.
    This game is about the micro cosmos and the physical interaction. Flying the bumble bee is affected by gravity, managing the food and energy reserves to reach the next blossom as improving your abilities
    with a short and longterm perk system.
    BuzzyBumbleBeeÂ´s conception was funded by the <a href=https://jahresbericht.fff-bayern.de> FFF Bavaria</a> in 2023/2024 .

<div class = "text2wide"> <p>Bubble Room (UnrealEngine 4.27, c++ and BP, VR for PC-VR or APK), may become a game at some future time with a geometric and axiomatic basis in look and haptics. 
  Until here it is just a "spline drawing on meshes" and 
  "using mathematical functions for instanced objects in 3D" working example. This test involved
  how much nausea a missing floor for VR players is causing.

  <div class = "text2wide"> <p> In 2020 i started as product owner and programmer to develop architectual visualisations in a VR game for <a href= https://unrealestate.net> UnrealEstate GmBH Augsburg </a> for the purpose of
    high level PR material for real estate projects. Interactive concepts the suit into this context, like changing floor materials, light or wheather settings rounded the fully immersive VR experience.
. The used 3D Models originated from 
    real construction plans. Viewing these buildings inside and outside in VR enabled a close to reality impression for these projects. Light settings, weather change and  
    environmental surroundings tried to come close as possible to reality. Performance optimization and intuitive interaction was the challenge to solve in this project. The video shows an in VR gameplay
    in our showroom project.
