      <h2>######## EXPERIMENTAL NARRATION ######</h2>
      <div class = "subtext">
        <p> Reception of any kind of media is learned like a language inheriting the history
          of how content is presented, how things are understood or not and how the film industry 
          always says "it has to be like this - is not working". Our cultural inheritence of catharsis 
          plots language, general image aesthetics, montage techniques find in many iterations of approaches to new combinations altering and widening the
          language of our reception. For propaganda one might say, we learn deconstruction a little after 
          we fell for it.</p>

      student protest material, as well as documentary sound and video material of various actions. The documementary aims for a reconstruction of the situation by a strict commitment to the chronology. It presents
      deep insides in the interplay between public media and protest movements, next to document the evolution and decay of the movement and the reaction of berlins and Germanys politics to it itself.  <a href="movies_Interessenvertretung.html">InteressenVertretung</a> </p>
