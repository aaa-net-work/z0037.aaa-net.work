THE PLUSHY FAMILY (39pt)

(AAA#ooc-010532, 66 min, 2018, Berlin) (14.4pt)


is an experimental eye-witness documentary, portraying people’s thoughts, interactions and experiences with social media platforms and a  personalised internet. The movie shows in a synchronised two camera perspective a turn based un-moderated many people conversation. 

As filter bubbles pop, fake news loom in clouds of smoke, surveillance is over present, personalised data is extracted and deep machine learning exploits privacy, today´s opinions loop in echo chambers. While old arguments get deconstructed and a new inter subjective awareness is emerging, the audience has the privilege to reflect on “what was the Now and what has the Now become”. The montage technique and camera concept are an experimental approach that aimed for a novel narrative form, in order to sustain a higher attention of the audience to follow complex spoken arguments and chains of thought.The material was recorded in winter 2017, before the disclosure of the Facebook Cambridge Analytica data scandal, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), before the European Commission’s fine on Google for breaching EU antitrust rules and so on and so forth. The ongoing progress in social media platforms and the surrounding debate deconstruct an imprint of a past assertive claim recorded in “The Plushy Family”.
